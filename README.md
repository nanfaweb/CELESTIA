CELESTIA - The aim of this project is to develop an interactive database-driven
website that provides users with scientific data on stars, planets, galaxies, and
other celestial bodies. The platform will allow users to explore various celestial
systems, read scientific data, and engage with the content by creating their own
virtual solar systems. By integrating user interactivity with astronomical data, we
aim to make space exploration engaging and educational for users.

Key features:

1. User Authentication:
  o Users can register and log in to the platform.
  o Registered users become a "star" in the website's unique
  constellation system that consists of all registered users.

2. Celestial Database:
  o A comprehensive collection of data on celestial bodies, including
  stars, planets, and galaxies.
  o Search and filter functionality for users to find specific celestial
  objects.

3. Interactive Solar System Creation:  
  o Users can design their own solar systems by placing stars and
  planets.
  o Customization options for celestial bodies (e.g., size, colour,
  atmospheric properties).

4. Scientific Data Display:
  o Each celestial body will have detailed scientific information
  available for users to read.
  o Users can add and save their own notes for each celestial body.
  o Data visualization tools (e.g., interactive maps, graphs) to enhance
  understanding.

5. User Engagement and Community:
  o Users can interact with and explore each otherâ€™s custom solar
  systems.
  o A dynamic and evolving "constellation" that grows with each new
  registered user.
